# Speech Recognition AI Assistant
This is a simple AI assistant that uses speech recognition to take user input and respond accordingly. The AI assistant is capable of responding to specific commands such as "What time is it?" and "What is today's date?" as well as having a conversation with the user using the OpenAI language model.

## Getting Started
To use this AI assistant, you will need to install the following dependencies:

- speech_recognition
- pyttsx3
- pywhatkit
- openai

You can install these dependencies using pip.

`pip install speech_recognition pyttsx3 pywhatkit openai`

## How to Use
- Run the code in a Python environment.
- python main.py
- The program will listen to the user's voice input via the microphone.
- The user can ask specific commands such as "What time is it?" and "What is today's date?" and the AI assistant will respond.
- The user can also have a conversation with the AI assistant by speaking naturally.

## Limitations
This AI assistant is limited by the accuracy of the speech recognition software and the capabilities of the OpenAI language model. The assistant may have difficulty understanding certain accents or dialects, and may not always respond appropriately to user input.
